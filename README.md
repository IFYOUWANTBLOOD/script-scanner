# script-scrapper
find keywords in all game scripts

the best tool to patch anti cheats

how to use
1. Add some keywords (example: 'magnitude', 'Kick', 'Health')
2. Select the threads amount (how many scripts gonna be checked by once, i recommend using 15)
3. Start then the results gonna show up in the "Results" section, you can click on them to copy to the clipboard

*. Progress can be see in the console (F9)
